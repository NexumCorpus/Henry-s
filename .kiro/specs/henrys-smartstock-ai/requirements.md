# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Henry's SmartStock AI is an AI-powered inventory management system designed specifically for Henry's on Market, a historic bar and restaurant in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. The system will revolutionize operations by automating inventory tracking, predicting demand based on seasonal tourism patterns and local events, optimizing supplier orders, reducing waste, and providing actionable insights. The platform will be a web-based application with mobile companion apps, leveraging machine learning for predictive analytics, computer vision for automated stock checks, and natural language processing for voice commands.
